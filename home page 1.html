                            <p>
                                I pray this letter finds you in the best of health.<BR>
                                We are one day away from the 14th of February. A day made special for celebrating
                                love. I disagree with the conception of celebrating your loved one on one day.
                                Darling you are too special to be celebrated on one day alone. Which is why I choose
                                to celebrate you everyday. Through every conversation, every shared laugh and shared
                                look. Through fulfilled promises and thoughtful gifts. For it would be an injustice to
                                choose to celebrate you on one day alone. Nontheless, for the sake of the occassion, I will 
                                celebrate you. Maybe slightly more than I have been doing with every moment we have together.
                            </p>
